# DegenToken

## Introduction
DegenToken is a Solidity smart contract that represents a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It extends the functionality of ERC20 token and includes additional features such as ownership and a game store where users can redeem their tokens for in-game items.

## Getting Started
To use this contract, you need to have a Solidity development environment set up. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone 
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Compile the contract: `npx hardhat compile`
4. Deploy the contract: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji`
5. Interact with the contract using the provided functions.

## Contract Details
The `DegenToken` contract is built on top of the OpenZeppelin library. It inherits from `ERC20` and `Ownable` contracts.

### Game Items
The contract includes a game store where users can redeem their tokens for in-game items. Each item is represented by the `GameItem` struct, which contains the name and price of the item. The available game items are:

1. DegenNFT - Price: 70 tokens
2. Avatar - Price: 100 tokens
3. DegenTokens - Price: 150 tokens

### Functions
The contract provides the following functions:

- `mint(address to, uint256 amount)`: Mints new tokens and assigns them to the specified address. Only the contract owner can call this function.
- `redeem(uint256 itemId)`: Allows users to redeem their tokens for a specific game item. The item is identified by its ID.
- `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Overrides the `transfer` function from the ERC20 contract to enable token transfers.
- `burn(uint256 amount)`: Burns a specific amount of tokens for the caller's account.
- `balanceOf(address account)`: Returns the token balance of the specified account.
